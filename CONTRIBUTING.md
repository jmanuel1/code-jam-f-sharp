[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

Hi there! Thanks for taking the time to contribute. Just to be clear, this repo
is meant to host *my* solutions to Code Jam problems. Thus, I won't accept pull
requests for solutions from others, even if they're better. However, I'll
consider bug fixes, improved docs, and even optimizations that don't change the
basic idea of a solution. I'll also consider changes to the CLI app that don't
change or add to the solution algorithms.
